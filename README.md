# 🏏 Cricket Player Statistics Analysis

This project involves data analysis and visualization on a dataset containing statistics of international cricket players. Using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, we explore various player performance metrics and create insightful plots.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset `Most Runs.csv` includes information like:
- Player Name
- Matches Played
- Innings
- Runs Scored
- Batting Average
- Strike Rate
- 100s and 50s scored
- Highest Score

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

1. **Top Run Scorers**  
   A bar chart showing the top 10 players based on total runs.

2. **Most Centuries Scored**  
   Highlights the top 10 players who have scored the most centuries.

3. **Correlation Heatmap**  
   Shows how performance metrics like matches, strike rate, and average are correlated.

4. **Distribution of Averages**  
   Histogram displaying the distribution of batting averages across players.

5. **Most Matches Played**  
   Top 10 players who have appeared in the most matches.

6. **Highest Individual Scores**  
   Players with the highest single-innings scores.

7. **Pie Chart of Top 5 Run Scorers**  
   A pie chart showing the proportion of total runs by the top 5 players.

8. **Linear Regression Model**  
   Predicts a player's batting average based on their total runs using linear regression.
